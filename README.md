# WorldCitizen DonActor üéÅ

DonActor App was my first project at Reskill Americans Program. The app was intended to facilitate the donation process of clothes. In this project, I conducted the five design thinking stages (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test). I designed the UX/UI for the app itself as well as the name and Logo.

The project was intended to serve a fictional Non-profitable organization (World Citizen).

The App was color-coded to designate three different types of users (Donators, Intermediators, and Benefited person/institution).

In this repo, you can find some artifacts of this projects, such as:
