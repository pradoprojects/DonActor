DonActor App was my first UI project. The app was intended to facilitate the donation process of clothes. In this project, I conducted the five design thinking stages (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test). I designed the UX/UI for the app itself as well as the name and Logo. All the artifacts in this repo were designed in a time window of four weeks (average hours spent: 2 hours/business day)

The project was intended to serve a fictional Non-profitable organization (WorldCitizen).

The App was color-coded to designate three different types of users (Donators, Intermediators, and Benefited person/institution).

In this repo, you can find the following artifacts of this projects:

* [The Project Brief](https://github.com/pradoprojects/DonActor/blob/main/Brief_DonActor_App.pdf)
