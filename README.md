# WorldCitizen DonActor

WorldCitizen DonActor was my first project at Reskill Americans Program. The app was intended to facilitate the donation process of clothes. The project encompassed the five  design thinking stages (Empathizing, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).

The project was intended to serve a fictional Non-profitable organization.
